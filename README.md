## 📄 Research Context
This Admin Website was developed as the **critical backend system** of DealRadar.  
It ensures that only verified MSMEs and legitimate promotions are displayed in the mobile applications used by businesses and consumers in Naga City.  

The mobile applications (MSME & Consumer apps) were developed by my teammates.  
I was solely responsible for the **Admin Website** component.
